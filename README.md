# Course_Projects

This repository, showcases some of the many projects completed during my university coursework. Below are brief descriptions of some of the featured projects:

## Kepler Exoplanet Search Results

This project involves data pre-processing and the training of classifiers to predict the presence of exoplanets. The classifiers used are ensemble models implemented from scratch, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying machine learning principles.

## Hill Climbing Problem

Focused on solving a hill-climbing problem, this assignment delves into how TensorFlow utilizes optimization techniques to minimize the cost (loss) function in a neural network. The objective is to efficiently assign packages to a set number of trucks using various Python-coded algorithms. Three distinct approaches were implemented: random package assignment, random optimization by truck swapping, and simulated annealing by truck swapping.

- Random Package Assignment:
  - Randomly assigns packages to a sorted list of trucks based on their capacities.
  - Ensures each truck is designed to have three deliveries with an appropriate number of packages.
  - Tracks unassigned packages to guarantee all are delivered with one package assigned per truck.
- Random Swapping of Trucks:
  - Serves as an optimizer to minimize the cost function of the initial assignment.
  - Iterates through the initial assignments, swapping packages allocated to trucks.
  - Ensures the weight of swapped packages does not exceed the truck's capacity.
- Simulated Annealing by Truck Swapping:
  - Utilizes the simulated annealing algorithm, a metaheuristic approach to solve optimization problems.
  - Starts with an initial solution and iteratively generates new candidate solutions by perturbing the current solution.
  - Accepts some solutions worse than the current one to avoid local optima, gradually reducing the acceptance of worse solutions as the temperature decreases.
    
## Dodge Challenger 3D Model and Animation on Maya

This project involves the creation of a 3D model and animation of a Dodge Challenger using Autodesk Maya. The detailed modeling and animation showcase proficiency in 3D design and animation software.
